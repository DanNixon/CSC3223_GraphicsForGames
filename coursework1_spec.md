CSC3223 Coursework 1
====================

Due: 9:00am 18th November 2015

This coursework builds on the skills you have learned in graphics programming,
to construct a software rasteriser and render a scene involving various
graphical primitives.

The challenge is to use C++ to build a software rasteriser and utilise it to
draw a space scene consisting of triangles, lines and points.

The specification is deliberately open-ended.

The scene may include a star-field, a planet surface, space debris, and/or
basic space ships.

Examples of old games which may be used as inspiration are the Atari arcade
games Asteroids and Tempest.

The software rasteriser does not need to run at gameplay framerate.

You will not lose marks for using code from the tutorials, although further
marks will be gained for introducing more complex elements.

Effort should be taken to implement any such features as part of a unified
graphics pipeline.

You will also not lose marks for basing the scene on outside sources.

Remember that all such external material must be referenced and attributed
properly.

The coursework should include all of these elements:

- A star-field, or night sky, consisting of point primitives.
- A planet or asteroid or similar consisting of line primitives.
- A spaceship or similar consisting of triangle primitives with interpolated
  colour.
- Movement of some scene elements (translation).
- Elements made from triangle strip primitives and triangle fan primitives.

The advanced features are:

- A three dimensional perspective view.
- Independent three dimensional rotation of scene elements.
- Textured primitives.
- Semi-transparency.

Deliverable items (submitted via NESS):

1. Executable and source code (zip file).
2. PDF document containing screenshots. Two pages maximum.

Deliverable items (demonstration):

3. Demonstrate the program running in the practical session on 18th November
   to a demonstrator.

Marks Available (25):

- Implementation of the required features gains up to 12 marks. (These features
  implemented with well-structured code guarantee 12 marks).
- Advanced rendering techniques gain up to 12 marks.
- Document gains up to 1 mark.
- The marking scheme is indicative only, and may be modified in individual
  cases if that is to your advantage.
- A first class submission entails a balanced scene of different primitive
  types including all of the required and advanced features. The code must be
  clearly formatted.

Learning Outcomes:

- Define relationship between the elements of a rendered scene and rasterised
  two-dimensional display technology.
- Identify appropriate primitive types for rendering graphical scene elements.
- Describe graphical representations mathematically.
